## Overview
Using data obtained from a clinical study of belly button bacteria, we have designed a webpage to display the metrics of each bacteria type in each individual. The displayed charts can be filtered by selecting a new test subject by ID. The charts are as follows: Bar - displaying the top ten bacteria found for the selected subject, Gauge - displaying the number of times the belly button was washed weekly, and Bubble - displaying the total amount of bacteria found by type for the selected belly button.
